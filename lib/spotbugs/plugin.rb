module Danger
  # This is your plugin class. Any attributes or methods you expose here will
  # be available from within your Dangerfile.
  #
  # To be published on the Danger plugins site, you will need to have
  # the public interface documented. Danger uses [YARD](http://yardoc.org/)
  # for generating documentation from your plugin source, and you can verify
  # by running `danger plugins lint` or `bundle exec rake spec`.
  #
  # You should replace these comments with a public description of your library.
  #
  # @example Ensure people are well warned about merging on Mondays
  #
  #          my_plugin.warn_on_mondays
  #
  # @see  mathroule/danger-spotbugs
  # @tags java, android, spotbugs

  class DangerSpotBugs < Plugin
